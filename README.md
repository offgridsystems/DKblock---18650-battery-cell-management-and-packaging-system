# DKblock
Firmware for open source DKblock battery management system. The code is written in mostly C with some C++ routines. It is written as mostly inline code for transparency and for speed of development. This firmware is designed for the Teensy 3.X (for DK Supervisor) and for the Teensy LC (for the DK Block Manager) lines of tiny USB development boards from PJRC at www.pjrc.com.
